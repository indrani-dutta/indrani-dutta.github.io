                    <p>I am Indrani Dutta, a CSDA student from NSUT. I love challenging myself and am always hungry to learn something new. I believe grit, hardwork and determination helps achieve everything in life. I want to build and groom myself to be industry ready.</p> 
                    <p>Besides academics, I have learnt Kathak for 5 years, am an avid reader and a passionate polygot. I like balance and enjoy engaging in non academic activities. Hope you get to know me better from this porfolio!</p>

                        <p>Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterâ€”in theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy acting to an extent where I was in a good mind to choose acting as my field. I have always been a part of school skits and have heartily enjoyed the entire process!</p>

                        <p>Languages are a beutiful system of communication to embody the complex feelings of human to make them understood by others. It also gives me the oppurtunity to learn about various splendid cultures across the globe. </p>
                        <p>I have always had a nag for learning new languages. Currently, I am equipped with knowledge in 5 languages - Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, English and Spanish. I wish to learn many more in the coming years!  </p>

                        <p>Tell me that you want to go for a run and I will be in my track suits and sport shoes in no time. The satisfaction of pushing my body to run an extra mile is what keeps me moving!</p>

                        <p>I spend a lot of time listening to music. I spend even more time singing my heart out to those songs over and over! </p>
                        <p>You'll find me humming something or the else almost 90% time. Although, I wouldn't call myself a good singer (I wish I could), singing out to myself helps me control my feelings and emotions. It also helps me concentrate better.

                        <h1>READING</h1>
                        <p>I love to reading in my free time. I often end up reading an entire book overnight. My parents have always had me enrolled in a library, this always promoted a reading atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>My favourite genre are- Mystery and Fiction. A cup of hot chocolate, a good book and a warm blanket is all I need to keep me going!</p>

                        <p>If I was to choose one mode of transport for the rest of my life I would choose my skates, even though I know it wouldn't be the smartest decision. </p>
                        <p>Just putting on my skates and becoming one gives me more joy than anything else. Feeling the warmth of the sun, the light breeze caressing me as I dance through paths in my skates gives me undeniable exhilaration.</p>
